# ABOUT THE PROJECT
The project is aimed at analysing the penetration of telecommunication in some selected countries given some factors such as the number of internet users, the GDP etc. 
The objective is to create a visualization dash board that will clearly show
1.	The trend in the fixed telephone and mobile phone usage of seven most advanced and 7 least advanced countries in the world
2.	Compare the percentage of the each population that have adopted the use of mobile phones
3.	Show the relationship between a country’s mobile phone usage with the country’s Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in order to see if there is a trend.
4.	Compare the mobile phone usage among different continents represented by the selected countries

## Tools
Statistical Analysis was done with **R** while the visualisation dashboard was created with **PowerBI**
